,"I was actually surprised by three jobs:  Political scientists, real estate brokers, and management analysts.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Regarding the poli scientists I thought a lot of that work was tied to lobbying corporations, and so I didn't expect the compensation to be that high.  ",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For the brokers, I thought that would have been more lucrative, especially as over time I assumed brokers would find themselves dealing with more high-profile properties. I also didn't expect the hotbed for them to be in the midwest. Not  a lot of people live there, so I thought demand would have been way lower, discouraging lots of real estate activity there.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,"When it comes to management analysts, I didn’t expect that to be a quicker-growing field. I didn't realize growing economies and businesses would mean a need for more hands to be able to effectly plan, mange and direct said companies.",,,,,,,,,,
